Body: My name is Mohammad Hossein Tootian, and I am 17 years old. From an early age, I was considered gifted. I could memorize the Quran with ease, but I set it aside, planning to return to it later. Unfortunately, I never did, and this tendency to abandon things has become a habit.
I start projects with enthusiasm, but I often get exhausted and let them go. This has made me lazy and unmotivated. Additionally, I&#039;ve spent the last four years essentially addicted to video games and YouTube, which has only worsened my situation.
I had no academic issues till sixth grade, but when I entered Helli, I hit a roadblock. I struggled to achieve good exam scores, beside that we were lab mice for the teachers. Despite this challenging environment, I didn&#039;t change my approach.
Now, I&#039;ve completed 11th grade, but I still feel mentally weak. This year is going to be the most impactful of my life , and I realize that I must make a significant change.
